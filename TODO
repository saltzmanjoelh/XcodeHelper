-- TODO --
Create HelloDependencies project where we have an OSX project with a Dependencies subdirectory for testing. Test with CLI Kit
Remote run debugger
Add "Add Docker Build Phase" under Build in Docker
Include option for Update Packages to be recursive. This will allow for a dependencies project to be updated as well
Update app icon to handle dark mode
Update status menu to show progress when it's chewing on something
Got Update Packages - Docker working with XPC. Make sure that everything else does as well
Remove Symlink Dependencies?
Add targets that I had to remove like kernel ext, iokit driver, metal lib, spotlight index extension
Provide a browser for create archive or specify env vars


-- Backlog --
There should be a Console tab in the main window that shows output
    it should be html based so maybe just a webview
    errors are red, don't show empty error output like we currently do
Replace disabled name of current target with app image

-- Bugs --
