Got Update Packages - Docker working with XPC. Make sure that everything else does as well
Replace Build in Docker with "Add Docker Build Phase"
Remove Symlink Dependencies?
Provide a browser for create archive or specify env vars

-- Backlog --
There should be a Console tab in the main window that shows output
    it should be html based so maybe just a webview
    errors are red, don't show empty error output like we currently do
Replace disabled name of current target with app image
