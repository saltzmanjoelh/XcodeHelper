The extra banner file contains the last log. XcodeHelper stores only that log. Maybe we should append to the log file from the CommandRunner instead
Banner messages duplicate the final message with title "Xcode Helper" instead of command name. Possibly remove it.
Clicking a banner results in file not found error when messages are coming through. Even after all have completed it still doesn't show the file
    Cli tools create logs but don't provide a directory. Maybe move the default log path into the logge r
